About me

## üóÉÔ∏è Projects

###  [PAN Card Tampering Detection](https://github.com/lucyneee/pan-card-tempering/blob/main/PAN_Card_Tampering_Detection_.ipynb)
**Description:** The "PAN Card Tampering Detection" project aims to detect tampering in images of PAN cards by comparing a provided image with an original reference image. The purpose of the project is to identify whether a PAN card has been altered or tampered with, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of identity verification processes.

**Technologies:** Python - Pandas, OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image, Matplotlib

### [Fake News Classifier](https://github.com/lucyneee/Fake-News-Classifier/blob/main/Fake_News_Classifier.ipynb)
**Description:** This project aims to build a Fake News Classifier using machine learning techniques -  Natural Language Processing (NLP). Given a dataset with news articles, the model is trained to predict whether a piece of news is real or fake based on the provided text.

**Technologies:** Python - Pandas, nlp_utils, seaborn, sklearn (train_test_split, CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer)
